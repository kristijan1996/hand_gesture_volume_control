# hand_gesture_volume_control

Detect and estimate hand landmarks using pretrained **Hands** model
from *mediapipe*. Using OpenCV track landmarks in real-time, measure
distance between tip of index finger and thumb, and use the distance
to proportionally control the system volume (or brighteness, or whatever).
